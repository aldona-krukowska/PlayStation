# PlayStation
A fragment of a fictitious Play Station homepage, including a menu, a product with price and an animated button.

## Motivation
I did this project just for practice. I tried to keep the code clear, as simple as possible, and moreover to make the site reponsive. I also wanted to write the first script for the drop-down menu in the mobile version.

## Build status
I am now working on developing the site with additional content.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
